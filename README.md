# nosql-challenge
This assigment had us import a json file using the Terminal and name the database "uk_food" and the collection "establishments." Following the creation of the uk_food database, the assignment required us to update it with additional records and removing all establishments with the designation "Dover Local Authority." We then are required to figure out each establishment's Hygiene and ranking scores and compare them. Overall this assignment went fairly well and I only really needed to figure out (with the help of the internet) how to properly import my json files. I forgot to add the --jsonArray and so initially it was giving me an error when trying to import.
